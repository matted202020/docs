# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - A Summary

The following is a summary of the rights and responsibilities of those affected by GDPR. This article also includes enforcement information.

## Applicability

GDPR applies to a wide scope of territory -- it includes non-EU based services/companies that possess data on EU residents.

## Consent

Consent notifications must:

* Be clear and easy to understand
* State the purpose of the data involved and how it will be processed
* Be as easily revoked as it is to grant

## Rights of Individuals

Individuals have the right to:

* See the data the company has about them
* Know how their data will be processed or used
* Be forgotten (the individual may ask the controller of their data to erase the data in question, cease disseminating the data, or halt further data processing)
* Portability (the individual can ask for their data in a standard, machine-readable format and can transit their data to another data controller)
* *Not* be subjected to automatic decision making (a process typically called **profiling**)
