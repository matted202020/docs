# Auth0 Sub-Processors

*Last Modified: Aug 1, 2017*

Auth0, Inc. (“Auth0”) uses certain sub-processors, including third parties, as listed below, as part of providing the Auth0 Services as described in the Auth0 Master Subscription Agreement (“MSA”). Terms defined and used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the MSA.

## Terms

**Sub-Processor**: A sub-processor is a third party data processor used by Auth0, who may have access to or process production Auth0 Service Data and data used in the support of the Auth0 Service, either of which may contain Personal Data and, if Customer added such data to the Auth0 user profile, Sensitive Personal Data. Auth0 engages different types of sub-processors to perform various functions as part of providing the Auth0 service, as explained in the tables below. 

## Due Diligence

Auth0 undertakes to use a commercially reasonable selection process in order to periodically evaluate the security, privacy and confidentiality practices of its chosen sub-processors who may have access to or process production Auth0 Service Data.

## Contractual Requirements

Auth0 requires that, and periodically evaluates whether, its sub-processors satisfy the obligations of a data processor (or sub-processor) set forth in Auth0’s Data Processing Agreement (the “DPA”), including but not limited to the requirements to:

* Process Personal Data based on data controller’s (i.e. the Subscriber’s) instructions (furnished by data controller through Auth0);
* Use personnel who have been subject to background checks and subject to a contractually binding obligation to observe data privacy and security, to the extent applicable, pursuant to applicable data protection laws;
* Regularly train individuals to whom they grant access to Personal Data in security and data protection;
* Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures (including those to which Auth0 adheres which are equally relevant to their processing of Personal Data) and provide an annual certification that evidences compliance with this obligation. In the absence of such certification Auth0 reserves the right to audit the subprocessor;
* Promptly inform Auth0 about any actual or potential security breach; and
* Cooperate with Auth0 in order to deal with requests from data controllers, data subjects or data protection authorities, as applicable.

This policy does not give Subscribers any additional rights or remedies and should not be construed as a binding agreement. The information herein is only provided to illustrate Auth0’s engagement process for sub-processors as well as to provide the actual list of third party sub-processors used by Auth0 as of the date of this policy and which Auth0 may use in the delivery and support of its Services.

If you are an Auth0 Enterprise Subscriber and wish to enter into our Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”), please email us at privacy@auth0.com.

For all Subscribers who have executed Auth0’s standard DPA, Auth0 will provide notice via this policy of updates to the list of sub-processors that are utilized or which Auth0 proposes to utilize to deliver its Services. Auth0 undertakes to keep this list updated regularly to enable its Subscribers to stay informed of the scope of sub-processing associated with the Auth0 Services.

Pursuant to the DPA, Auth0 Subscribers can object in writing to the processing of its Personal Data by a new sub-processor within thirty (30) days after updating of this policy and shall describe its legitimate reasons to object. If Subscriber does not object during such time period the new subprocessor(s) shall be deemed accepted.

If a Subscriber objects to the use of a sub-processor pursuant to the process provided under the DPA, Auth0 shall have the right to cure the objection through one of the following options (to be selected at Auth0’s sole discretion):

1. Auth0 will cease to use the sub-processor with regard to Personal Data;
2. Auth0 will take the corrective steps requested by Subscriber in its objection (which remove Subscriber’s objection) and proceed to use the sub-processor to process Personal Data; or
3. Auth0 may cease to provide or Subscriber may agree not to use (temporarily or permanently) the particular aspect of an Auth0 Service that would involve use of the sub-processor to process Personal Data.

Termination rights, as applicable and agreed, are set forth exclusively in the DPA.
The following is an up-to-date list (as of the date of this policy) of the names and locations of Auth0 sub-processors.

## Sub-Processors Used for Auth0 Service

Auth0 controls access to the infrastructure that Auth0 uses to host Service Data submitted to the Services, other than as set forth below. Currently, the Auth0 multi-tenant production systems for the Services are located in hosted AWS (Amazon Web Services) data center facilities in the United States, Europe and Australia. Private Instance Services are hosted in data centers specified in the contract for each Private Instance.
